CHANGELOG

1.0.3 (06/28/20)
- 1.16 support

1.0.2 (06/23/20)
- Gate Exits can now be modified. An Owner using a Gate Constructor on
  a gate they own (or an Admin on any gate) can modify the gate's exit
  location to their currently standing location.
- Gates now teleport players to the center of a gate exit's block, and
  not the edge.
- Rewrote the gate orientation check for opening gates which should
  prevent issues where some gates would spawn Nether Portal blocks in
  the incorrect orientation to the gate.

1.0.1 (06/18/20)
- Supports 1.13 and 1.14

1.0.0 (06/12/20)
- First release
